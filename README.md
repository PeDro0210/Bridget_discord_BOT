# THE BRIDGET BOT

## What is this?
Well Bridget bot is a Bot powered by CHATGPT, that will techically do the same job as CHATGPT, with the exception that it a new personality, and is trained on a different dataset.

## How do I use it?
Well, you can boot up the discord script and put any keys that you want (open ai key and discord key) and then you can talk to it in discord. 

## How do I train it?
well, just talk to her, is that simple, there's a dataset already with some conversations, but you can add more, just talk to her, and she will learn from you. (I hope lmao)

## How do I add more datasets?
Don't, dude, the avergae tpm for chat-gpt is like 40,000, with one is more that enough, and sometimes it even forgets what you said and her initial prompt, so don't add more datasets, just talk to her.

# Hope all of you enjoy it

### Btw, remebear you need to make an .env file for the keys
